Yield is a keyword in Python that is used to return from a function without 
destroying the states of its local variable and when the function is called, 
the execution starts from the last yield statement. Any function that contains 
a yield keyword is termed a generator. Hence, yield is what makes a generator. 
The yield keyword in Python is less known off but has a greater utility which one 
can think of.
