'''
Python Functions is a block of related statements designed to perform a computational, logical, or evaluative task. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in it over and over again. 

Functions can be both built-in or user-defined. It helps the program to be concise, non-repetitive, and organized.

Syntax:

def function_name(parameters):
	"""docstring"""
	statement(s)
	return expression

Creating a Function
We can create a Python function using the def keyword.

Example: Python Creating Function

# A simple Python function

def fun():
	print("Welcome to GFG")

Calling a Function
After creating a function we can call it by using the name of the function followed by parenthesis containing parameters of that particular function.


'''
# A simple Python function
def fun():
	print("Welcome to GFG")

# Driver code to call a function
fun()
