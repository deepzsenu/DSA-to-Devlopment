## üîç What is Abstraction?

**Abstraction** means:

> *"Hiding internal details and showing only the essential information to the user."*

It allows you to define *what* a class or method should do, without specifying *how* it should do it ‚Äî the internal working is hidden.

## üß† Real-Life Analogy

Think of driving a **car**:

* You turn the key ‚Üí engine starts.
* You press the brake ‚Üí it slows down.

But do you know how fuel injection or brake hydraulics work? Not really ‚Äî and you **don‚Äôt need to**.

That‚Äôs **abstraction**. You interact with only **necessary functionality**, not the messy internal code.

## üß∞ How to Achieve Abstraction in Python?

Python uses the **`abc` module** (Abstract Base Classes):

### ‚úÖ 1. Import `ABC` and `abstractmethod`

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
```

### ‚úÖ 2. Create an abstract class

```python
class Vehicle(ABC):
    
    @abstractmethod
    def start(self):
        pass
```

### ‚úÖ 3. Subclasses must override the abstract methods

```python
class Car(Vehicle):
    def start(self):
        print("Car started with key ignition")

class Bike(Vehicle):
    def start(self):
        print("Bike started with self-start")
```

### üîí Rules to Remember

| Rule                                                 | Explanation                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ You can‚Äôt instantiate abstract classes             | `v = Vehicle()` ‚ùå                        |
| ‚úÖ Subclasses **must** implement all abstract methods | or they'll stay abstract                 |
| ‚úÖ Abstract classes can have **concrete methods too** | i.e., normal methods                     |
| ‚úÖ Great for designing frameworks / APIs              | where method signatures must be enforced |

## ‚úçÔ∏è Example

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def sound(self):
        pass

    def sleep(self):
        print("Sleeping...")

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Woof!")

d = Dog()
d.sound()     # Woof!
d.sleep()     # Sleeping...
```

### ‚úÖ Benefits

* Hides internal logic from user
* Promotes reusability & security
* Enforces method structure across subclasses
* Great for plugin-based or modular design
